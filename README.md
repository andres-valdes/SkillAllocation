# AutoShield
A tiny BepInEx plugin for Valheim to auto-equip your shield when equipping a one-handed weapon.

Should also serve as a pretty decent starting point for creating a Valheim mod from scratch, as it includes the bare minimum you need to get started. I wrote this thing in VSCode, fwiw, because Visual Studio and Resharper are both much larger than something like modding Valheim warrants.
